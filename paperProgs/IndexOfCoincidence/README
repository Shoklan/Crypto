The paper "The Index of Coicidence and Application to Cryptography" written by William F. Friedman talks about the Vougel Quintuple Disk Cipher. And, this is my implementation of the cipher.

The implementation works exactly as expected. There is a difference in that the paper inserts a space after every four characters; I find this unnecessary, but I'll do it for completeness sake.
